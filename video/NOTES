Project ideas for fun (Instagram)

- Fade in for photos
  1. find an image, crop to square, not too big (360 x 360?)
  2. fade in the image from 3 color channels (RGB) respectively and sequentially
  3. advance experiment can have 3 channel fade in interleaved, plus mix with fade out

- flash montage
  1. collect photos of same topic (e.g. hashtag from instagram)
  2. flash images in video
  3. possibly montage several images into a frame

- iPhone burst stop motion
  1. burst photos shoot around or walk
  2. use photos as frame for video (~0.3 to 0.5s per frame)
  3. skip frame if burst is too fast

- skip frame of videos
  1. take a video (my videos or youtube videos)
  2. take every X-th fram
  3. give long pause, make it look like stop motion
