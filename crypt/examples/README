crypt, not crypto.

The first step mainly test the python's pycrypto library (https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto)

In it there are several components

- Crypto.Cipher (symetric encryption)
- Crypto.PublicKey (Asymmetric)
- Crypto.Hash (Hashing libs)

Notes:
- core lib written in c
- Asymmetric crypto seems much slower than symetric
