Simple flask app. hitting qps limit. macbook air ~500/s. vdi ~900/s.
CPU not saturated, but qps doesn't go up, even with gunicorn 2 workers.


Tried  --worker-class=gevent for gunicorn in vdi, qps bumped to 1000/s.
cpu system dropped to 0. all cpu usage is user cpu.



It does look like locust is the bottleneck. Used FastHttpUser instead of HttpUser and
greatly bumped qps. Also, should serve static content instead of echo.

After some simple tuning, a simple static serving, multiple gevent workers, multiple locust gevent testers.
Peaked ~16k qps, CPU almost saturated on vdi.
