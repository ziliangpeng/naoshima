A small tool to detect duplicate files in your disk.


**Motivation**: 

My files are just thrown everywhere. 

I use web browser heavily everyday, and downloaded a lot of files(images, documents, musics) and many of them are duplicated!

And every time I took some photos, they will be imported to my systems several times(by manual, or auto-import by photo apps)!

This small program is just written to help me organize my files a bit better.
