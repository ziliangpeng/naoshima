# An automated Instagram following bot.

This is an evolving project, as I'm experimenting different ideas, and continuously improving code quality.

Following ideas were tried:

- follow people based on hashtag search
- follow my followers' followers
- follow followers of a high profile account
- apply filters and intelligence selecting who to follow

As the project keeps growing, there are 2 directions:

**A well architected, fully productionized distributed system.**

It can be a bot simultaneously running for several users, efficiently, fault tolerant, and can scale. Data should be shared among users too.

**A data driven project**

Record high quality data of what the dot does (follow people, like posts, etc) and what happens (followed by someone).

Then we can do data driven in 2 ways:

1. easy for human to query data, get insight, can come up with new ideas or iterate on ides

2. apply machine learning to train better filters, or new strategy to discover users.


## One more thing

My account is not the best account, but it's always not the best account that can get the most followers.

This is an experiment of finding the right audience, improve targeting, market something, and getting engage.

You will produce a lot of content, and you will never be the best, there is no such thing as 'best' in content creation.

But you can always find a lot of audience.
