How to set up shadowsocks (assume ubuntu)

1. install

sudo apt-get install python-pip python-m2crypto
sudo pip install shadowsocks


2. config

sudo vi /etc/shadowsocks.json

{
"server":"your_server_ip",
"server_port":8000,
"local_port":1080,
"password":"your_passwd",
"timeout":600,
"method":"aes-256-cfb"
}


3. start
sudo ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start



Note:
- shadowsocks is not released to pypi any more, can't get 0.9.0 (required by a new version of a dependency)
- can install from github .zip, but 0.9.0 zip has the wrong version
- need to download 0.9.0, unzip, modify version number in setup.py, and pip install from directory
