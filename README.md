My solution to TopCoder Single Round Matches(SRM) and CodeForces Algorithm Competitions, and possible more.

The purpose of this project is to force myself to write elegant code. Most of the code does not follow any
code convention, because I mostly write these code in hurry(within the competition's time), but at least I
try to make it look elegant, especially the structure to be clear.
