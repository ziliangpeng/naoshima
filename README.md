A small tool to detect duplicate files in your disk.


Motivation: 
My files are just thrown everywhere. 
I use web browser heavily everyday, and download a lot of files(images, documents, musics) and many of them are duplicated!
And every time I took some photos, they will be imported to my systems several times(by manual, or auto-import by photo apps)!
This small program is just written to help me organise my files a bit better.
